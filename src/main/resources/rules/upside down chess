The white and black pieces are switched  so that White's pieces are on the 8th rank,
with pawns on the 7th rank, one step away from promotion.
The starting position looks like a standard chess starting position
but from the other player's perspective.
As the pawns are blocked by pieces in the starting position,
the game always starts with a knight move and smother checkmates are common.
